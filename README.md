# An application that can be utilised by bands to both calculate their emissions and allow them to calculate offsets.

The carbon emissions from touring bands are one factor in anthropogenic climate change, which needs to be mitigated. The research will explore creating an application for small-scale bands to calculate their emissions and allow them to calculate an offset.
